Generate a detailed solution for the following coding problem:

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
${problemInfo.problem_statement || "No problem statement provided."}

CONSTRAINTS:
${problemInfo.constraints || "No specific constraints provided."}

EXAMPLE INPUT:
${problemInfo.example_input || "No example input provided."}

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
${problemInfo.example_output || "No example output provided."}

LANGUAGE: ${language}

I need the response in the following format:
1. Code: A clean, optimized implementation in ${language}
2. Your Thoughts: A list of key insights and reasoning behind your approach
3. Time complexity: O(X) with a detailed explanation (at least 2 sentences)
4. Space complexity: O(X) with a detailed explanation (at least 2 sentences)

For complexity explanations, please be thorough. For example: "Time complexity: O(n) because we iterate through the array only once. This is optimal as we need to examine each element at least once to find the solution." or "Space complexity: O(n) because in the worst case, we store all elements in the hashmap. The additional space scales linearly with the input size."

Your solution should be efficient, well-commented, and handle edge cases.
